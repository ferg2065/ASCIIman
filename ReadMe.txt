This is a highly-inefficient side scroller written for a programming class. Lots of optimization could happen, but I don't have time and am kind of proud of this for having been a second year CS student. 

Have fun with it, I don't really care what you do with it as long as you don't turn it in for your own homework assignment.

It compiles in Visual Studio on Windows, and is theoretically portable since it uses the windows version of the curses library.
